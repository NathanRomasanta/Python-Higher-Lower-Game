## Features
The project starts with the system getting two random data values from the dictionary which are used to compare each other to (checking also if the random values are the same). The system will now print out these data values as readable text for the player and then asks the player which one of the variables has a higher instagram follower count. If the player gets it right, the system continues by adding one point for the user and generating another set of values for the next round, else the game ends and the user gets a display of how many points they scored.

Some key features.
* Uses a dictionary from another file as the database of the game.
* random a & b variables and variable checker.


## Setup
If you want to play this project for yourself simply download the Python file and open it in your IDE.
